								<p>The case: NewBank, a digital bank that launched two years ago, was quickly ranked #1 in customer satisfaction. However, due to increasing competition from new entrants, NewBank has now dropped to #6 in the rankings. <b>The newly-appointed CEO aims to bring NewBank back to the top three.</b></p>
								<p>Breaking down the bank's commercial strategy into 4 manageable pillars is a great first step. We can adopt the <b>STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) framework</b> when breaking down each pillar: </p>
								<p><b>1. Customer Segments</b>
									<br>
									<div class="image-container">
									<img src="images/customer_segmentation.jpg" 
     									
     									width="920" 
     									height="500">
									</div>
									<br><b>What to do:</b> breakdown market potential and current customers into groups based on characteristics like<br>
									<ul style="margin-top: 0;">
										<li>Demographics (age, income)</li>
										<li>Behaviors (digital use, spending habits)</li>
										<li>Needs (mortgage seeker, small business owner)</li>
										<li>Profitability</li>
									</ul>
									<p><b>Questions to analyze:</b>
									<ul>
										<li>Most and least profitable customer segments</li>
										<li>In which segments are we losing market share? Why are customer leaving?</li>
										<li>Which segments are competitors targeting and winning?</li>
										
									</ul></p>
									<p><b>Action:</b> conduct detailed analysis to identify and prioritize high-value customer segments.</p>

								</p>
								<p><b>2.Product Portfolio</b>
									<br>
									<div class="image-container">
									<img 
     									src="images/products.jpg" 
     									
     									width="920" 
     									height="500">
									</div>
									<br><b>What to do:</b> analyze the full range of products and services the bank offers.<br></p>
									<p><b>Why:</b> customer needs have evolved. NewBank's products may be outdated, too complex, or contain unprofitable products that drain resources. Bank may be losing customers because products no longer solve their problems effectively.</p>
									<p><b>Questions to analyze:</b>
									<ul>
										<li>NewBank's product portfolio vs competitors. Any major gaps?</li>
										<li>Which of the bank's products are most and least profitable</li>
										<li>Are products tailored to target customer segments</li>
									</ul></p>
									<p><b>Action:</b> rationalize the product portfolio - invest in new enhanced product development (eg: a better online banking app), redesign existing products, or eliminate non-profitable ones. Goal is to provide products that meet needs of target audience.</p>

								</p>
								<p><b>3.Channel Mix</b>
									<br>
									<div class="image-container">
									<img 
     									src="images/channel_mix.jpg" 
     									
     									width="920" 
     									height="500">
									</div>
									<br>This refers to how the bank offers its services. Channels include physical branches (expensive to operate and maintain), ATMs, website and mobile app.</p>
									<p><b>Why:</b> the move from physical to digital banking represents the industry's most significant shift. Branches are costly for both parties, imposing huge operational costs on the bank while costing customers valuable time and convenience.<br>A seamless digital experience is primary reason why customers choose or leave a bank. New Bank's competitors may have a more efficient, lower-cost channel mix or a superior digital experience that is attracting customers.</p>
									<p><b>Questions to analyze:</b>
									<ul>
										<li>Cost to serve each channel</li>
										<li>Which channels do priority customer segments prefer to use for different activities (opening an account vs checking balance)</li>
										<li>Our digital experience vs competitors</li>
										<li>Are channels being used effectively to not just serve customers but also cross sell other products</li>
									</ul></p>
									<p><b>Action:</b> optimize the channel mix. This will likely involve investing heavily in digital capabilities while potentially consolidating the physical branch network. The aim is to meet customers where they are, provide a superior experience, and lower the bank's operating costs.</p>

								</p>
								<p><b>4.Pricing Strategy</b>
									<br>
									<div class="image-container">
									<img 
     									src="images/pricing.jpg" 
     									
     									width="920" 
     									height="500">
									</div>
									<br><b>What to do:</b>analyze how bank prices its products and services. This includes account fees, interest rates on loans and deposits, promotional offers, and bundled pricing discounts.</p>
									<p><b>Why:</b> in a competitive market, price is a powerful lever. New Bank could be losing customers because its fees are too high, its interest rates aren't competitive, or its pricing structure is too confusing. Conversely, it might be underpricing its products and leaving money on the table. A smart pricing strategy isn't just about being the cheapest; it's about aligning price with the value delivered to specific customer segments.</p>
									<p><b>Questions to analyze:</b>
									<ul>
										<li>How prices and fees compare to competitors for core products</li>
										<li>Customer sensitivity to change in prices (price elasticity)</li>
										<li>Is the bank perceived as providing good value for the price charged</li>
										<li>Can pricing be used strategically to attract and retain target customers (relationship based pricing)</li>
									</ul></p>
									<p><b>Action:</b> develop a dynamic and segment-specific pricing strategy. This could involve lowering fees for certain products, offering better rates to high-value customers, or creating attractive product bundles to increase customer loyalty and profitability.</p>

								</p>

								<p>
									Since you can't move in all directions at the same time, <b>where should you begin?</b>
									<br>
									<div class="image-container">
									<img class="center-image" 
     									src="images/paths.jpg" 
     									
     									width="920" 
     									height="500">
									</div>
									<p class = "large-text"><b>Analyze customer feedback to understand unmet needs</b></p>
									Understanding customer needs becomes the 'North Star' that guides every subsequent action. Emphasizing customer feedback helps in:
									<br>
									<ol>
										<br>
										<li>Diagnozing the root cause not just the effects</li>
										The drop from #1 to #6 is a symptom. The root cause is that a significant number of customers are making an active choice to leave NewBank or choose a competitor instead. Analyzing customer feedback is the most direct way to understand the <b>"why"</b> behind that choice.
										<br>
										<b>With feedback:</b>the bank might hear directly from lost customers: "Your mortgage application process was a nightmare".  This feedback points directly to the real pain points - the unmet needs - that are driving the market share loss.
										<p><li>Creating a foundation for hypothesis driven action</li>
										By starting with the customer, the analysis for the other three pillars becomes focused and purposeful:
										<ul>
											<li><b>Product Portfolio:</b> instead of asking "What products can we build?", you ask "What products should we build to solve our target customers' unmet needs?"</li>
											<li><b>Channel Mix:</b> instead of asking "How can we optimize our channels?", you ask "What channels do our target customers prefer for different activities?"</li>
											<li><b>Pricing Strategy:</b> instead of asking "How can we match competitor prices?", you ask "What is the value of solving this unmet need for our customers, and how can we price our solution to reflect that value?"</li>
										</p></ul>
									</ol>
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>What conclusions can be drawn from this image?</b>
									<br>
									<div class="image-container">
									<img class="center-image" 
	 									src="images/cust_rating.jpg" 
	 									
	 									width="620" 
	 									height="300">
									</div>
									<br>
									It's safe to say customers find the product lacking, so enhancing the current product and expanding product offerings to match customer needs is a good approach.
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>Product offerings from NewBank vs its competitors</b>
									<br>
									<div class="image-container">
									<img class="center-image" 
	 									src="images/product_offerings.jpg" 
	 									
	 									width="1050" 
	 									height="300">
									</div>
									<br>
									Looking at this image, we can conclude that dental insurance and a foreign exchange platform are missing from NewBank's product offerings.
									<br>
									Determine how significantly each new product would improve customer experience, expand share of wallet and drive retention. Products rated highest must take precedence.
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>Data on customers and their preferences</b>
									<br>
									<div class="image-container">
									<img class="center-image" 
	 									src="images/cust_pref.jpg" 
	 									
	 									width="1100" 
	 									height="300">
									</div>
									<br>
									Above data suggests that NewBank's customers are mostly young, mobile driven and travel a lot. Based on this, adding a commission free foreign exchange is the product to pursue.
									<br>
									Once the CEO agrees, develop a plan and timeline to <b>MVP - Minimum Viable Product</b>
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>What is a Minimum Viable Product?</b>
									<br>
									<div class="image-container">
									<img class="center-image" 
	 									src="images/mvp.jpg" 
	 									
	 									width="800" 
	 									height="300">
									</div>
									<br>
									A <b>Minimum Viable Product</b> is the version of a new product that allows a team to collect the <b>maximum amount of validated learning</b> about customers with the <b>least amount of effort.</b>
									<br>The goal isn't to launch a perfect, feature-rich product. The goal is to test your most critical assumptions.
									<br>
									Defining Minimum and Viable in this context:
									<ul>
										<li><b>Minimum</b> refers to the features. You build only the absolute core functionality needed to solve a single, primary problem for a specific group of early users (your "early adopters")</li>
										<li><b>Viable</b> the product can't be buggy, broken, or unusable. It must work reliably and provide real value to the user</li>
								</p>

								<p>
									MVP can be understood better with an analogy - the skateboard to the car.
									<br>Imagine the user's problem is getting from Point A to Point B.
									<br>
									<b>What MVP isn't:</b>
									<br>You deliver one wheel, then a chassis, then an engine, then the car body. At each stage, the user has nothing that solves their problem.
									<br>
									<b>What MVP is:</b>
									<br>You focus on solving the core problem - getting around, with increasing levels of sophistication
									<br>
									<div class="image-container">
									<img class="center-image" 
	 									src="images/mvp1.jpg" 
	 									
	 									width="600" 
	 									height="300">
									</div>
									<ul>
										<li><b>MVP 1 (Skateboard):</b> It's basic, a little wobbly, but it solves the core problem. You get feedback: users like it but say it's hard to balance.</li>
										<li><b>MVP 2 (Scooter):</b> You add a handlebar based on the feedback. It's more stable and easier to use. You've learned and iterated.</li>
										<li><b>MVP 3 (Bicycle):</b> You add pedals and a seat. Now it's faster and more efficient.</li>
										<li><b>MVP 4 (Motorcycle):</b> You add an engine. Now it's powerful and requires no physical effort.</li>
										<li><b>Final Product (Car):</b> You add a roof, doors, and comfort. It's the complete vision.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<p>
									To sum it all up, MVP follows the Build-Measure-Learn Loop:
									<br>
									<div class="image-container">
									<img class="center-image" 
	 									src="images/mvp_loop.png" 
	 									
	 									width="600" 
	 									height="300">
									</div>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Build</b> the MVP quickly</li>
										<li><b>Measure:</b> you release it to measure actual customer behavior</li>
										<li><b>Learn:</b> analyze data and user feedback to learn what works and what doesn't</li>
									</ul>	

								</p>

								<p>
									<b>Final recommendations to the CEO of the client:</b>
									<br>
									In order to return to being a top-rated bank, NewBank should focus on its product offering by developing a commission-free foreign exchange. Adding this feature is likely to have the largest impact according to customer sentiment and demographics.
